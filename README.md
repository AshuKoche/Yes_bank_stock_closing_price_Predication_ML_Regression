# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
## Project Summary -
Yes Bank was a very reputable bank till 2018. After 2018, the bank came under the umbrella of risk-inflated banks. This project would help not only the Yes bank but all those banks who want to predict their future and are in a conundrum for their future. So Machine Learning is helping us resolve the issue of all those companies and firms who want to gather some courage to survive in the market for longer.
By predicting the price with the acquaintance of Machine Learning especially the linear Regression and other regressors, which helped firms and companies.
In this project, the monthly Open, Close, Low, and High prices of Yess Bank stock have helped to train the model on which learning occurs and then the respective prediction occurs.

## Problem Statement
Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock process of the company and whether Time Series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This Dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock's price for the month.

## Conclusion
Write the conclusion here.

All the features are moderately correlated with each other and they are related to the target variable.

The best Algorithm to use for this dataset is Ridge Regressor, the regularization algorithm.

The untuned model was able to explain 95% of the variance (R2 score = 0.95) on a train set, while the tuned model was able to explain 97% of the variance (R2 score = 0.97) on a train set which is a tiny improvement of 2 %.

On a test set, the model performed better untuned with 94% of accuracy, after tuning the accuracy reduced to 93 %.

The Ridge regression is performing even better than Random Forest Regressor. The RFR is giving 90 % accuracy on test data whereas the Ridge is giving 94% accuracy.
